# Heart Disease Risk Analysis: A Data-Driven Approach

This project explores **heart disease risk factors** using unsupervised and
pattern-mining techniques to uncover hidden structures in medical data.
Instead of analyzing individual variables separately, the project applies
**dimensionality reduction, clustering, and association rule mining** to
identify high-risk patient profiles efficiently.

## Project Aim
Heart disease is a major global health concern with multiple interacting risk
factors. The goal of this project is to:
- Simplify complex medical data
- Identify latent risk dimensions
- Group patients by risk level
- Discover frequent interactions between risk factors

The analysis supports **early risk detection** and more interpretable
medical decision-making.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains clinical and demographic information commonly used in
heart disease studies.

### Key Variables
- `age`: Age of the patient
- `sex`: Sex (1 = male, 0 = female)
- `cp`: Chest pain type
- `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure
- `chol`: Serum cholesterol
- `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar
- `restecg`: Resting ECG results
- `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved
- `exang`: Exercise-induced angina
- `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise

The target variable is excluded to focus on **unsupervised risk discovery**.
